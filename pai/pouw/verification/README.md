# Description

This experimental code stub contains code to simulate verification (work in progress).

You must start the server for validation `server.py`. It will listen to calls from clients such as `client.py` (that contains an example obtained by runnning `start_cluster.py`).

If you want to test an example, you must have a mined block in the `/output/blocks/` directory and copy-paste its name in the corresponding variable in `client.py`.
